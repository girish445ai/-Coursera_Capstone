But the main problem is to select a location with less competition and more chance of growth we are going to discuss this topic and try to find a answer in this project."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### PROBLEM:\nThe main objective of this project is to gather data and run data analysis algorithm to find the best possible location where if the property builders construct building he could make franchices to open new shopping malls at his sites.So this project aims to use the datascience and meachine learning algorithms like K-mean clustering and provide an answer to the question:In Vizag(the city of destiny)-A.P-India,if a land developer want to construct a shopping mall what would be the best location to do so?"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Target Audience of this project:\nThe target audience of this project are the land builders/developers,and investors looking to open/invest in new shopping malls in Vizag-A.P-India,Visakhapatnam is one of the fastest growing cities in the state, is slowly getting a cosmopolitan look. The city is witnessing a huge demand for restaurants, thanks to the boom in industrial and business sectors, which has ensured a change in lifestyle and fashion preferences.So this project will help them take better decision of the choice of location on opening new restaraunts."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data:\n### The following data must be acquired to solve this problem:\n1.List of neighborhoods in Vizag.<br>\n2.Latitude and Longitude coordinates of the neighborhoods.This data is required in order to plot the map and also to acquire the venue details.<br> \n3.Venues of the neighborhoods specially that of restaurants,on which we will perform clusetring algorithms."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Source's of data and methods to acquire them:\nFirst to acquire the vizag neighborhoods data we will use web scraping techniques to extract the data from this wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Neighbourhoods_in_Visakhapatnam, there are total 121 names in this page which are the neighborhoods of vizag, which we will extract.Then we will acquire the coordinates of these neighborhoods using Python Geocoder package as a result we will get the latitude and longitude coordinates of these neighborhoods.\n\nNext step is to use the Foursquare API to get the venues data of these neighborhoods.Foursquare has one of the largest database collection with about 105+ million places and is used by over 150,000 developers.Foursquare API will provide us many venues we are interested in the shopping mall venue.This project will test many of the data science skills, from web scraping, working with Foursquare API, data cleaning, data wrangling,data manipulation, to data visualization(generating map using folium) and meachine learning techniques(clustering) implementation. In the next week assign ment the entire project with the methodology used all the steps taken to get the answer of our question will be discussed along with the outcome of the project."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Methodology:\nThe first step is to get the neghbourhoods names of visakhapatnam by scraping the data from this wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Neighbourhoods_in_Visakhapatnam,) using BeautifulSoup library and next we need to get the coordinates ie; latitude & longitude values of each neighbors we could do this in many ways we can use geocoder library to get coordinates but it didnt work for me so i decided to generate the coordinates using the excelsheet extension so i save the output data frame after scraping as a excelsheet and downloaded that excelsheet and using Geocode extension i generated the coordinates for cooresponding neighbourhoods then i uploaded this new excel sheet as dataframe onto my jupiter notebook and next i visuvalized the neighbourhooda on the map by using Folium package.This visuvalization step gives us a sanity check to make sure that the geographical coordinates generated are correct and are correctly plotted.\n\nNext, we will use the Foursquare API to get the top 100 venues of each neighbourhoods withina a radius of 3300 meters.We need to register a Foursquare API developer account in order to obtain the Foursquare ID and Foursquare secret key. We then made API calls to Foursquare API by passing the geographical coordinates of the neighbourhoods in a python loop. Foursquare will return the venue data in JSON format and we will exteact the venue name, venue category, venue lat, venue long. With this we can check how mand venues are returned for each neighbourhood usin panda code. The we will analyze each neighbourhood by grouping the rows by neighbourhood and taking the mean of the frequency of occurrence of each venue category. By doing so, we are also preparing the data for use in clustering. Since we are analysing the \"Restaurants\" data, we will filter the \"Restaurants\" as venue category for the neighbourhoods.\n\nLastly, we will perform clustering on the data by using k-means clustering. K-means clustering algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible. It is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms and is particularly suited to solve the problem for this project. We will cluster the neighbourhoods into 3 clusters based on their frequency of occurrence for \"Restaurants\". The results will allow us to identify which neighbourhoods have higher concentration of Restaurants while which neighbourhoods have fewer number of Restaurants. Based on the occurrence of Restaurants in different neighbourhoods, it will help us to answer the question as to which neighbourhoods are most suitable to open new Restaurants."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
