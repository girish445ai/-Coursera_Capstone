But the main problem is to select a location with less competition and more chance of growth we are going to discuss this topic and try to find a answer in this project."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "             "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Problem: \nThe main objective of this project is to gather data and run data analysis algorithm to find the best possible location where if the property builders construct building he could make franchices to open new restaurants at his sites.So this project aims to use the datascience and machine learning algorithms like K-mean clustering and provide an answer to the question:In Vizag(the city of destiny)-A.P-India,if a land developer want to construct a restaurants what would be the best location to do so? "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Target Audience of this project:\nThe target audience of this project are the land builders/developers,and investors looking to open/invest in new restaurants in Vizag-A.P-India,Visakhapatnam is one of the fastest growing cities in the state, is slowly getting a cosmopolitan look. The city is witnessing a huge demand for restaurants, thanks to the boom in industrial and business sectors, which has ensured a change in lifestyle and fashion preferences.So this project will help them take better decision of the choice of location on opening new restaurants.\n  "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data:\n### The following data must be acquired to solve this problem:\n1. List of neighborhoods in Vizag.\n1. Latitude and Longitude coordinates of the neighborhoods.This data is required in order to plot the map and also to acquire the venue details.\n1. Venues of the neighborhoods specially that of restaurants,on which we will perform clusetring algorithms. \n\n### Source's of data and methods to acquire them:\nFirst to acquire the vizag neighborhoods data we will use web scraping techniques to extract the data from this wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Neighbourhoods_in_Visakhapatnam, there are total 121 names in this page which are the neighborhoods of vizag, which we will extract.Then we will acquire the coordinates of these neighborhoods using Python Geocoder package as a result we will get the latitude and longitude coordinates of these neighborhoods.\n\nNext step is to use the Foursquare API to get the venues data of these neighborhoods.Foursquare has one of the largest database collection with about 105+ million places and is used by over 150,000 developers.Foursquare API will provide us many venues we are interested in the shopping mall venue.This project will test many of the data science skills, from web scraping, working with Foursquare API, data cleaning, data wrangling,data manipulation, to data visualization(generating map using folium) and meachine learning techniques(clustering) implementation. In the next week assign ment the entire project with the methodology used all the steps taken to get the answer of our question will be discussed along with the outcome of the project.  \n\n\n\n\n                                                        Project by: R.S.V.GIRISH"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
